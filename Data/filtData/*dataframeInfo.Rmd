LIST OF ALL DATAFRAMES PRODUCED IN THE CLEANDATA FILE AND WHAT THEY CONTAIN

All dataframes produced from the clean data file are filtered with the following steps:
1. remove all data from "bad sample" nests. these include nests where the queen or several workers died, food was not replaced, or for some other reason are unusable
2. remove all data from nests that contain less than a threshold duration of total video (threshold defined in the cleanData file)

# camDur
camDur contains the duration in seconds of video watched for all nests, split out by early, late, nest, and foraging
  rows: 
      one row per nestID
  columns:
      nestID = nestID
      forLen = seconds of total foraging video
      nestLen = seconds of total nest video
      totalLen = seconds of total video
      FNratio = ratio of foraging to nest video
      earlyFor = seconds of early foraging video
      earlyNest = seconds of early nest video
      lateFor = seconds of late foraging video
      lateNest = seconds of late nest video
      earlyLen = seconds of early video
      lateLen = seconds of late video
